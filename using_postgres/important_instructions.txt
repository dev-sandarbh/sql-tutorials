From now on, i'm going to use PostgreSql Databse with pgAdmin
You can download it from here:
	https://www.postgresql.org/download/ 

Just copy and paste this url in your browser's address bar and download the required software as per your system.

After that i've given  3 CSV(.csv) files to import data from and get your Database up and running....

Steps to import csv data into your database:-
1) Create a new database in your pgAdmin and give it any name of your choice. 
2) Open Query Tool in your pgAdmin and write the following code

'''
	COPY CustomerInfo(cust_id, cust_name, cust_segment, cust_age, cust_country,
				 cust_city, cust_state, cust_postal_code, cust_region) 
	FROM 'C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\data\copy_from_here\Customer.csv'
	DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER; 
'''

But remember that this code will work once you create the tablename, column names and datatypes of the columns same....
Specifiy path correctly....

3) Repeat same procedure for other two .csv files as well in order to get their data as well!!
